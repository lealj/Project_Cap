# Investigation into GDP per Capita and Mortality Rate of Countries Over Time. 

Data Science project testing hypotheses: 
"There is no association between a country's GDP per capita and its mortality rate. 
"There is no relationship between a country's geographical location(region) and its GDP per capita or mortality rate over time. 

Analyzed GDP per capita and mortality rate data from 200+ countries over a 60 year period. Techniques used to establish a correlation between the two data sets include
regression, k-means clustering, decision tree classifier, and multi-layer perceptron classifier. 

Our methods determined a negative correlation between GDP per capita and mortality rate, and a potential association between GDP per capita, mortality rate, and a 
country's region. 

As our conclusions are indicative of associations, this was an oberservational study, so we cannot establish causation.
